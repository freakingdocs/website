## Write some docs

1. Fork the repository - https://github.com/freakingdocs/website
1. Clone your forked repository
1. On mac, `brew install hugo`
1. Change to the root of the project
1. Run `hugo new <dirname>/<my-new-doc-file.md>`
1. Above, `<dirname>` should be an existing directory under the docs directory
1. If you want to start an entirely new section you will need to create a new directory under docs: `mkdir -p docs/<dirname>`
1. Any new section directory needs it's own root-level `_index.md` file
1. Write something clever to describe the new section
1. Finally, push your changes up and open a pull request
