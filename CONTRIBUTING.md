For now:

1. Fork this repository
1. Clone your forked repository
1. On mac, `brew install hugo`
1. Change to the root of the project
1. Run `hugo new <dirname>/<my-new-doc-file.md>`
1. Above, `<dirname>` should be an existing directory under the docs directory
1. If you want to start an entirely new section you will need to create a new directory under docs.
1. Any new section directory needs it's own root-level `_index.md` file. Write something clever in this file to describe the new section.
1. Finally, push your changes up and open a pull request.
